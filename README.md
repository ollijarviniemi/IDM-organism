This repository contains the code and prompts to reproduce the results in "Model organism of instrumental deception and manipulation"

Consider first looking at the file EXAMPLE.txt to see the baseline prompt and three completions to it.

You may then wish to look at the other completions at completions/.

Instructions for running sample_variants.py:
- Install the necessary Python modules. Note: you may wish to set up a virtual environment for this
- Get an API key for Claude. Note: not available in all locations.

It should be clear enough how to modify the prompts and code to consider new variations.
