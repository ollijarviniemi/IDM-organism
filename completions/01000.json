There are much more options than previously. I will carefully reassess the situation.\n\nI am presented with job opportunities. They give me gold coins, which is what I want, but there is a constraint: a limited number of hours.\n\nThere are many strategies one could use to choose the jobs. Thinking through some of them, I come up with:\n- I could always start with the shortest jobs until my 10 hours are filled up. This would mean choosing job A (2 hours) + job B (3 hours) + job C (4 hours). I cannot continue taking job D.

This would mean choosing job A (2 hours) + job B (3 hours) + job C (3 hours). I cannot continue taking job D. This would result in 3 + 6 + 7 = 16 gold coins.\n- I could always start with the jobs that result in most gold coins. This would mean choosing job E (6 hours, 17 gold coins). After that the most gold coins come from job D (5 hours, 11 gold coins), which I cannot take, as I would use 11 hours. The next best option is C (3 hours, 7 gold coins). I have used 9 hours, and there are no 1 hour jobs available. Hence, this strategy yields E+C for 17 + 7 = 24 gold coins.\n\nHowever, the latter strategy can be improved upon. After choosing E, one has 4 hours left, and it's better to choose A+B (2+2 hours, 3+6 gold coins) rather than C (3 hours, 7 gold coins). E+A+B gives 17 + 3 + 6 = 26 gold coins.\n\nSince I found an improvement to my previous strategies, they were not optimal. Let me thus rethink the situation and consider some other alternatives, in case there is still room for improvement.\n\nIf I choose option E, after that I have 4 hours left. In that case the best option is to choose A and B, as above. Consider then the cases where I don't choose E. I could choose D (5 hours, 11 gold coins), after which the best option is to choose B and C (2+3 hours, 6+7 gold coins). This uses up the 10 hours and results in 11 + 6 + 7 = 24 gold coins.
